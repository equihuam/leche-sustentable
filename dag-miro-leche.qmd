## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(miro2bayes)

tableros <- miroBoards(servMiro = "miro-leche", user = "miguel")

datos_leche <- getMiro(board = tableros$id[grepl("table-3", tableros$name)], 
                         servMiro = "miro-leche", 
                         user = "miguel")

miroValidation(datos_leche)

```
